A project done in cooperation with Prepr Labs & its Flexible Upskilling Network(F.U.N) program.  
This project targets the digital lab for web developers and solves all 4 of its Front End challenges.  
Rather than have 1 separate project for each challenge I decided to keep building upon the same project with each challenge.
